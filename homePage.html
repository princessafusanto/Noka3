                <h3>FANS "OFFSIDE" CHEERING</h3><br>
                <p>The EVOS Legends match against Alter Ego in the sixth week of NoKa3CS Season 9 is one of the hottest matches so far. Not only the fierce action of the two teams, but also the cheers of the fans who continued to support until the last drop of blood.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, some of the cheers from unscrupulous fans were too "offside" or out of bounds. Taunting, yelling and psychics, which should have been intended to enliven the NoKa3CS atmosphere, have turned into personal insults. </p>
